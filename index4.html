          Good Morning to one and all present here! Today I am here to deliver a speech about education. 
It is usually a belief that education is the foundation for all-round development. 
Life is based on development and that developing and growing is life. 
If we describe this view into the perspective of education, 
we can sum up that education is the all-round development of the individual’s personality.
Thus,education is nothing but all-round development of the individual’s personality.
Education is a process of man-making.
Hence, education is necessary for all.
